# Artificial-Intelligence
Each of the five projects in this course focused on a specific topic in AI. Below is a brief description of each project.

### CA5: Neural Networks
This project was done in two phases. In [phase one](5/Phase1/AI_CA5_Phase1.ipynb), a multi-layer perceptron was built from scratch and then trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. In [phase two](5/CA5_Phase2.ipynb), the MLP model was built using Keras and TensorFlow to classify Chest X‑ray (Covid‑19 and Pneumonia) images.

### CA4: Machine Learning
In this [project](4/CA4.ipynb), models such as KNN, decision tree, linear regression, and random forest were trained on the [Kaggle’s House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/) dataset to predict sales prices using the scikit‑learn library.

### CA3: Naive Bayes
In this [project](3/CA3.ipynb), a Naive Bayes model was trained to perform sentiment analysis on Digikala product reviews.

### CA2: Genetic Algorithm
The objective of this project is to develop a genetic algorithm employing crossover and mutation operations to generate a logic circuit based on a given truth table.

### CA1: Search
The goal of this project is to find an optimal path in a snake game using search algorithms such as IDS, BFS, and A*.
